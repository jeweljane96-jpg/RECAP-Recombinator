# RECAP-Recombinator
A Python-based tool for fragment-based de novo drug design. Using the RECAP algorithm, it deconstructs FDA-approved drugs into accessible fragments and recombines them into novel molecules with promising drug-like properties. Optimized for memory usage and built with RDKit and ChEMBL.
